# SuiteCRM
In this repo code snippets for custom codes needed for modules and fields customization I dealed with through real world tasks I worked on.

# Tasks:
1- Adding-Buttons: Adding email and print as PDF buttons to custom modules.
2- Browser-Preview-EntryPoint: Add an entrypoint to make a pdf previewd on the browser without download.
3- field-filter: Make relate field search results short listed to specific criteria.
4- Fields: Create a fields manually in a custom module to be mapped with a system field.
5- Logic-hooks: Create logic hooks:
    a. Custom PDF regeneration with signature image included (e-signatures are saved as vectors and TCPDF reads JPG images so logic hook will convert image to be read by TCPDF and replaces the original PDF with the new signed one.)
6- Subpanel-Autofill: Autofill data in quickcreate from the parent module.
